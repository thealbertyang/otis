You'll be faced with both difficulties and opportunities, and your goal should be to make the most of all situations.

              <h5><b>Avoid Office Politics and Gossip</b></h5>
              <p>As with any social organization, the workplace is full of rumors and gossip. Your mission is to keep your nose clean of all of it -- and be sure not to associate too often with the office gossips or risk having your image associated with them. "DO NOT get involved in any trash talking around the office," says an English education grad. "Don't -- repeat -- don't solicit gossip."</p>
              <p>Magennis agrees: "Stay out of the office politics for as long as possible," he says. "It's inevitable that you will be exposed to them sooner or later, and you will most likely participate in them as well as it's human nature. But stay out of the game for the first few months."</p>

              <h5 class="full-width"><b>Ask Questions/Ask for Help</b></h5>
              <p>No one expects you to solve all the organization's problems on your first days on the job -- nor that you know everything -- so, relax a bit, and always ask questions or ask for help when you need it.</p>
              <p>Remember that it's better to ask before you've completed the task the wrong way and wasted all that time. "Be open-minded," suggests a English language and literature grad. "I think when you are just starting out, it is easy to feel somewhat competitive; you may feel that you have something to prove. In effect, that kind of thinking will probably land you in the unemployment line again. Be co-operative, LISTEN, ask questions -- no one expects you to know everything -- and communicate openly with colleagues and supervisors."

              <h5 class="full-width"><b>Discover Everything About Your New Employer</b></h5>
              <p>In theory, you should have already done your homework during the interviewing process, but there is always more to learn now that you are on the inside. "Get an employee handbook" exhorts a MBA grad with an information-technology concentration. "Don't act or think you know more about everything than your peers." In addition, gather all those reports and company literature and read up and become an expert on your organization.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col s12 m6 l6 padding-left">
              <h5 class="full-width"><b>Be a Self-Starter; Take Initiative</b></h5>
              <p>In most situations, in your first days on the job, you will be given small doses of work -- to let you get your feet wet. As you finish assignments and are ready to handle a bigger workload, take the initiative and ask for more assignments. Whatever you do, don't just sit there waiting for your next project. Agrees Ali von Staudach, senior account executive for CNET Networks, "Be proactive. Don't wait for an assignment. Stick up your hand and ask for something to do," advises von Staudach, a communication studies grad.</p> 

              <p>"Volunteer for things even though you don't know how to do it or what needs to be done to accomplish it," suggests Stephen Magennis, whose first job out of college was as a benefits analyst for Hewitt Associates, Orlando, FL. "There will be people [who need] help, and they will appreciate your efforts to start making an immediate impact. Many times, there may be some tasks that you can accomplish with a little guidance, which will probably free up time for someone who needs to work on more important items," Magennis offers.</p>

              <h5 class="full-width"><b>Take Notes/Go to Orientation</b></h5>

              <p>Unless you have a photographic memory -- and few of us do -- consider taking notes on all the various systems and rules of the organization. And no matter how boring they may sound, attend all orientation sessions. Nothing gets old faster than someone repeatedly asking how something works; such behavior shows a lack of attention to detail. </p>

              <h5 class="full-width"><b>Keep Personal Business on Company Time to a Minimum</b></h5>
              <p>Studies show that just about everyone conducts some amount of personal business on company time -- checking email, making dinner reservations, buying stuff online. Your goal is to keep your personal business to a minimum and stay focused on work.</p>

              <h5 class="full-width"><b>Work Full Days</b></h5>
              <p>"Be on time, come in early, stay a little later," suggests von Staudach. "Even though I have a 9 to 5 job, it has been expressed to my co-workers and me that our director expects us to be in at 8:30 and stay past 5 p.m. because it looks like we are go-getters and into our jobs." There's nothing that can affect your reputation faster than routinely coming into work late or leaving work early. Especially in these first days/weeks on the job, be sure you get to work early and leave no earlier than when the majority of your co-workers leave. An engineering grad adds, "Be dedicated and flexible. Once you have established yourself, you can leave early, go out for lunch, shift your hours, or take work home with you. But in the beginning, be totally dedicated to being there all the time and picking up as much as you can possibly handle."</p>

              <h5 class="full-width"><b>Establish a Good Attendance Record</b></h5>
              <p>Just as with working full days, it's important to show up to work every day and establish a good attendance record. Yes, there will be emergencies, and yes, you may get sick, but as best you can, try to make it to work every day during those first weeks/months on the job.</p>

              <p>“Listen, Listen, Listen…don’t act like a know-it-all right off the bat,” cautions one entry-level worker. “The idea is to communicate that you have some marketable skills and you are here to learn and apply your skills to help the organization achieve success.” One of the hardest skills to learn for some of us – especially extraverts – is that, when we are new to the organization, it’s better to listen then talk. You don’t want to get the reputation as the office know-it-all – or worse, someone who always has to have limelight. If you have a legitimate contribution, make it, but if not, do more listening and absorbing those first days on the job. </p>

              <h5 class="full-width"><b>Find a Mentor</b></h5>
              <p>You don't need to jump on this task your first day, but as you get introduced to senior staff, begin thinking about developing a mentoring relationship with a member of management above you -- and outside your department -- in the organization. Mentoring has numerous benefits, from a simple sounding board to someone who helps direct and advance your career within the organization.</p>

              <h5 class="full-width"><b>Show Appreciation</b></h5>

Tracking your accomplishments is great for any number of reasons -- for your personal satisfaction, for raise and promotion meetings, and for future job-hunting. </p>

              <h5 class="full-width"><b>Keep Your Boss Informed -- of Everything</b></h5>
              <p>Your boss is not a mind-reader, so keep him/her informed of how you are doing. Especially in those early days, meet with your boss to further establish a rapport and relationship. "Request meetings with your boss on a consistent basis to review performance. Express interest in moving ahead and ask what else you can be doing to get to that next step," advises von Staudach. Be sure she/he knows you are a self-starter and hard-worker. Just don't bring the boss every little problem; instead, for minor issues, ask for help from co-workers. </p>

              <h5 class="full-width"><b>Get and Stay Organized/Set Goals</b></h5>
              <p>If you're one of those super-organized people, this tip will be easy for you. The rest of us, however, need to develop a system for keeping track of meetings, appointments, assignments, and projects. Get an organizer or planner and keep on top of all your work. You certainly don't want to miss an early key deadline or meeting. And as you look ahead, set goals for yourself -- and then strive to achieve them. "I set goals for myself," notes a 2001 education grad. "I wanted to appear professional in my dress, posture, and speech. I wrote that goal on index cards and put them everywhere." </p>

              <p>No one expects you to have everyone's name down pat by the end of the first day or week, but if you are bad with names, now is the time to research some of the neat memory-aid tricks you can try to use. Certainly, as soon as possible, learn the names of every member of your team. And if you are in a situation in which you forget a person's name, the best solution is simply to apologize and ask the person's name again. </p>

              <p>"Network," advises von Staudach. “Take advantage of every opportunity to network with key people in your organization and profession -- attend staff meetings, professional organization conferences, trade shows -- every opportunity to meet colleagues in your field. Just because you have a new job does not mean you suspend your network; constantly manage and grow your network of contacts because you never know when a problem or opportunity will arise. And networking with key people can also help you in finding one or more mentors.</p>
