                	<p>As a sales rep at Otis, you are not alone in your sales endeavor.  We work as part of a team –  being a team player means that you are part of a wider Otis network.  The Otis team will be providing their support and expertise to you to ensure you successfully complete the program, and will continue to do so as you progress in your sales career, too.  You may be wondering how wide this network is, who is part of the network, and how you will identify and connect with everyone.  Let’s start with the local office you’re working in – you’ll just need to introduce yourself, ask questions – and listen and learn!</p>

                        <p>Hopefully by now, you have at least had introductions to all of the individuals in your branch office and at least know which position or department they are part of.  We’ve taken the time to identify the key positions in a branch office and provide you with a brief description of the role – but we also thought it would be helpful for you to understand how their individual roles impact your role as a service sales rep, because after all, EVERYBODY SELLS at Otis!</p>
