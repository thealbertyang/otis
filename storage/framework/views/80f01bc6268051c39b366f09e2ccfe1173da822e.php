          <p>During six months of the training program, you will regularly participate in INFORMAL AND FORMAL COACHING SESSIONS. Informal coaching will take place on daily basis – you should consider your daily engagements with more experienced employees as opportunities for you to develop a relationship for them to become your coaches. Business and personal goals will be set – formally and informally – through a series of discussions with local branch leaders and regional staff members.</p>

          <p>To maximize your potential and to provide the tools you need to succeed, we provide significant development opportunities outside your day-to-day responsibilities. These opportunities can be field experiences, special projects, and exposure to other areas of the business operations.</p>

          <p><img alt="" class="responsive-img img-float left" src="<?php echo e(asset('/img/training/05.jpg')); ?>"> To ensure your progress, you will be provided with REGULAR FEEDBACK while your performance is being monitored. Formal coaching will be done in three periods: 45-Days, 120-Days, and during the training conferences- the Sales Skills Training and Sales Boot Camp sessions.      

          <br/><br/>We expect you to help build our future, so we invest heavily to ensure you can. Each stage of the program contains a VARIETY OF ASSESSMENTS to determine your readiness for the next stage – or if other opportunities are more appropriate.

          <br/><br/>
          For example, it is possible that you are withdrawn from the program but still continue with a career at Otis – the regular, interactive feedback will identify these opportunities during the course of the program.</p>
