          <p>The first stage of your training is a 90-day session that will be a kick-start to your learning experience and is designed to build foundational business skills and enhance your technical elevator acumen. The initial part of this stage will be an introduction and orientation to the company as a whole. You will learn about our Three Absolutes: Safety, Ethics and Controls and participate in comprehensive training in these areas. You will be introduced to elevators through learning modules as well as participate in firsthand field experiences to see elevators being installed, repaired, and maintained.</p>

          <p>During this stage of training, you will have an opportunity to demonstrate your initiative and drive – in each experience, you will meet new members of the branch team who will introduce you to different aspects of our business. Make sure you take the time to get to know them, develop working relationships that will extend beyond your training period, and ask questions — this is your time to focus on learning!</p>
